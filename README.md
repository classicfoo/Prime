# Prime

A Qt-inspired calculator implemented in Python. The calculator evaluates
simple arithmetic expressions with percentage support and is presented as a Qt
GUI built with PyQt6.

## Usage (GUI)

Run the calculator as a desktop application:

```
python calculator.py
```

Alternatively, you can launch the window with:

```
python -m src.gui
```

Ensure `PyQt6` is installed (use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if needed).

## Running tests

```
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if needed
pytest
```
